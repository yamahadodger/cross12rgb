# generate_rgb_here.md

**FOREMOST, THIS FILE ISN'T THE PART OF THIS SCRIPT!**

Please generate crosshair RGB configs here yourself due to excessive amount of files to upload on GitHub.

To generate config files, check **DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES** for a file **RGBTOOL.7Z**.

If the **RGBTOOL.7Z** is corrupted, create a new one using spreadsheet **CONV_12HEX_TO_12DEC_V\*.ODS** that I made to generate batch program.

Thanks for attention!
