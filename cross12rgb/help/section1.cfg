echo"> cross12rgb.setcolor=ff*; which is equal to (255 R, 255 B, unchanged G)"
echo"> cross12rgb.setcolor=f**; which is equal to (255 R, unchanged B, unchanged G)"
echo"> cross12rgb.setcolor=f*; which is equal to (255 R, unchanged B, 0 G)"
echo"> cross12rgb.setcolor=*; which is equal to (unchanged R, 0 B, 0 G)"
