# Crosshair (12-bit) RGB Color Selector
A 12-bit RGB color selector made entirely using aliases and in-game console commands.

# What it does exactly?
It simplifies the process of selecting your desired crosshair color. You can even use this to apply your desired 12-bit crosshair into dedicated config file (see `How to use it?` section).

# How to use it?
To utilize the config entirely, make sure to download all config files (57 in total).

To make this config function, use the following game launch parameter: `+exec yamahadodger/cross12rgb`

To change your crosshair color with the [shorthand hexademical form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Shorthand_hexadecimal_form), use the following command: `cross12rgb.setcolor=FFF` ~~(FFF = F0F0F0, so; 240 R, 240 G, 240 B)~~ (actually, FFF = FFFFFF, so; 255 R, 255 G, 255 B).

To reload the config in case you face some trouble with this script, type in the game console prompt: `cross12rgb.reload`
